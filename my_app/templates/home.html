        <h1>Welcome to Freedom Wheels</h1>
        <p>
            We are a community dedicated to pushing back against the limitations that disabilities enforce on those they affect. Freedom Wheels empowers individuals in the North Lancashire area who experience Parkinson's and/or visual impairments to greater freedom and independence. We revel in the personal stories of our members and the growth and changes they undergo, and our proud of the social media community that is active here. Community is living together, sharing life, and we know that whoever has freedom, shall ride!
